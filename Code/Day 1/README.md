# Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data âš¡

## Topics ðŸ“ƒ
- **Printing** 
- **Commenting**
- **Debugging** 
- **String Manipulation** 
- **Variables**

## Auditorium Exercise â˜„

### **1. Printing**
```python
print("""1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.
2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.
3. Add 3g of Salt.
4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.
5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.""")
```

### **2. Debugging Practice**
```python
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
```

### **3. Input Function**
```python
print(len(input()))
```

### **4. Variables**
Write a program that switches the value stored in both the vaiables?
```python
a = input()
b = input()

c = a
a = b
b = c

print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)
```

# Project - Band Name Generator ðŸš€
Write down a code that produces name for your band based on the location you grew up in and your pet's name?
```python
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator!")

print("What is the city name you grew up in?")
city = input()

print("What is your pet's name?")
pet = input()

print(f"Your band name could be {city} {pet}.")
```
