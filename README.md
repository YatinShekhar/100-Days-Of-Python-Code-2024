# Introduction
I'm diving into the world of data science and therefore Python is a pre-requisite for that. I am taking up [#100DaysofPythonCode](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) challenge which will not only help me to see Python from the glass of data science but it will also help me to learn Python in a general manner. This challenge is created by [Angela Yu](https://www.github.com/angelabauer), which will not only enchance my coding skills, it will also show my consistency and discipline towards my learning.
